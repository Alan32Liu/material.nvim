# TODO

    -[ ] refactor syntax colors
         the current syntax colors are based on vscode-material-theme. We can do better !!!

    -[ ] update treesitter colors
         idea: define slightly lighter purple for user defined classes and types, and use the regular purple for built-in types

    -[ ] add a second treesitter color for TSField and a third for function parameters

    -[ ] update cmp colors to match built in syntax colors

    -[x] check which built-in editor highlights are not needed

    -[ ] add special background for LspReferenceText
