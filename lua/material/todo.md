# TODO

    - read the [manual](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/overview)

    - refactor syntax colors
      the current syntax colors are based on vscode-material-theme. We can do better !!!

    - update treesitter colors
      idea: define slightly lighter purple for user defined classes and types, and use the regular purple for built-in types

    - add a second treesitter color for TSField and a third for function parameters

    - check which built-in editor highlights are not needed

    - add special background for LspReferenceText
